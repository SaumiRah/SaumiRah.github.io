# Optimizing Gratuity

# Preface

This is the first part of an ongoing project analyzing the data surrounding my part
time job as a pizza delivery driver. This project originally started as an assignment for POL 315 at SFU. I returned to it later in 2022 to fully flesh it out.

# Section I. Research Question, Theory, and Hypotheses

I work a part-time job as a delivery driver at a pizza restaurant called
“Me-n-Ed’s”, located in Port Coquitlam, BC, and it’s a great job!
Management is very flexible with scheduling, and the restaurant uses
company cars to make deliveries which are fueled and serviced by company
dollars. While wage comprises the majority of a driver’s dollars per
hour, tips also greatly influence our bottom line. Say I work 5 hours at
\$15.20/h, making 40 dollars in tips will increase my dollars per hour
to 23.20! For comparison, according to indeed.com, the average salary
for a lifeguard in BC is 22.65 dollars per hours, which is less than
what I make delivering pizzas. Nevertheless, 40 isn’t always what we
make. Sometimes, we make as little as 15 dollars in tips, which only
increases one’s dollars per hour to 18.20. My goal is to maximize my
tips by any means available to me.

What could account for this variance in tips? Some obvious factors are
the amount of deliveries a driver takes during their shift and how much
pizza they sell over all; more frequent and bigger sales are intuitively
correlated with more tip money. How could I maximize these factors then?
As is always the case with restaurants some days of the week are busier
than others, and on busier days drivers take more deliveries (and
therefore make more money). This means I have some means of controlling
my tips by scheduling myself to work on the busiest days. I asked some
co-workers what they though the busiest day of the week was, and there
was a general consensus among drivers that either Fridays or Saturdays
are the busiest. Since I typically work three days per week, I want to
know on which three days I would end my shift with the highest tip-outs.
(A note on vocabulary: I use the terms “Tip-out” and “Cash-out”
interchangeably to refer to the amount of dollars in tips I make on a
given day).

My main hypothesis is that on average, the highest total tip-outs are on
Saturdays, followed by Fridays, followed by Sundays, i.e. weekends. To
confidently demonstrate this ranking, I essentially have to make a
complete ranking of each day of the week from best to worst in terms of
average tips. In the case that I cannot confidently demonstrate this, I
also make the logically weaker (but easier to prove) hypothesis that on
average, my tips are better on weekends. Instead of ranking 7 categories
representing each day of the week, we are simply comparing two
categories: Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays (Weekends), compared to
Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays (Weekdays).[^1]

[^1]: The pedantic reader will have noticed that I classified Friday as
    a weekend and consequently shook their head in disapproval. “Only
    Saturdays and Sundays are weekends. Fridays are weekdays.”, they
    might reproach. This traditional calendar taxonomy, garbed in an
    ontological gloss is at best a social convention, and certainly not
    an objective property of time itself (assuming time as such could
    have such properties). For the purposes of this study, it’s safe to
    reject this convention and replace it with one that is more
    practical for it’s ends. I work three days a week, so if I happen to
    demonstrate that weekends are better than weekdays in terms of tips,
    I can simply schedule myself to work on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
    If the pendant persists in his pedantry, we need not use the terms
    “Weekend” and “Weekday”, we can instead simply refer to the set of
    days containing “Friday, Saturday and Sunday”, and the set
    containing “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday”.

I was also curious about the roll the weather plays in the customers
decision to tip. I’m not primarily interested in the correlation between
rain and tips because it’s not something I can control to maximize my
tips, but I figured it might be a significant variable to control for.

# Section II. Preliminary Work

In Section II, I explain what data I’m using to conduct my research as
well as an explanation of each variable. Furthermore, I demonstrate how
I loaded, categorized and checked for data sanity in my data. I give
more details on this process in the R-code blocks below in the form of
notes.

``` r
rm(list = ls())
library(readxl)

#loading data
setwd("D:\\Everything\\School\\Me n Eds Sales Slips Data")
s <- read_xlsx("Slips.xlsx") #Sales receipts
```

``` r
## Sales Receipts
library(plyr)

# Generating a column to represent tips as a ratio of the sale amount.
s$TipPercent <- round(s$Tip/s$Amount * 100) 


s$Weekend <- s$`Day of Week` # Adding a Weekend dummy variable 
s$Weekend[s$Weekend == "Mon"|s$Weekend =="Tue"|s$Weekend =="Wed"|s$Weekend =="Thu"] <- 1
s$Weekend[s$Weekend == "Fri"|s$Weekend =="Sat"|s$Weekend =="Sun"] <- 0
s$Weekend <- factor(s$Weekend, levels = c(1,0), 
                    labels = c("Weekday", "Weekend")) 

s$Precipitation[s$Precipitation == 0.0] <- 0
s$Precipitation[s$Precipitation >0.0 & s$Precipitation<=2.5] <- 1
s$Precipitation[s$Precipitation >2.5 & s$Precipitation<=10.0] <- 2
s$Precipitation[s$Precipitation > 10.0] <- 3
#Classifying rain levels
s$Precipitation <- factor(s$Precipitation, levels= c(2,0,1,3),
                          labels=c("Moderate Rain", "Light Rain", "No Rain", "Heavy Rain")) 

# Re-ordering day of the week variable so Friday (day with most observations) is reference category
s$`Day of Week` <- factor(s$`Day of Week`, levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))
s$`Day of Week` <- relevel(s$`Day of Week`, ref="Fri") 

tpp <- ddply(s, c("Date", "`Day of Week`", "Weekend", "Precipitation"), summarize, #Compiling by Date
             TipSum = sum(Tip), #Cash-out
             AmountSum = sum(Amount), #Total sales amount on a given day (this includes tips)
             TipSumLog = log(TipSum), #Log transformation in anticipation of non-normality
             TipPercent = TipSum/AmountSum*100) #Tip Percent Frequencies 

tpp <- tpp[-c(37), ]
head(tpp)
```

This data set, labeled “Slips”, is data I manually collected and
compiled starting in January of this year (2022) until late March. My
data source was sales receipts. Sales receipts are receipts printed from
a credit machine when a customer pays for their order at the door as
proof of purchase. The credit machine prints two receipts, one for the
customer and one for the driver. If the customer does not want their
receipt - which is often the case - the driver will discard their extra
receipt in a paper bag in the company car they’re driving that day. Once
a week, I would collect each paper bag at the end of my shift and
compile them into an excel spreadsheet.

Each receipt only had three relevant pieces of information printed on
it: The price of the customers order in dollars, The amount the customer
tipped in dollars, and the *date* of the transaction. After compiling
around 350 receipts, I used an excel formula to determine the day of the
week of the listed dates, and then reduced that to either Weekend or
Weekday in R labelled *Day of Week\`* and *Weekend* respectively.
Furthermore, I found the percent the customer tipped on their order by
dividing the tip amount by the order amount and multiplying by 100.
Next, I made Friday the reference category of my Day of the Week
variable because it had the highest
![n](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;n "n")
value.

Next, I compiled all this data into another data frame sorted by Date.
For instance, I took two deliveries on January 7th, and made 5.31 on the
first one, and then 5.00 on the second one in tips. I simply took the
sum of all these values for a given date (10.31) and listed them in one
row, under the *TipSum* variable. In other words; *TipSum* represents my
cash-out on any given date. I did the same for the order amount,
labelled *AmountSum*. In precautionary anticipation of any skewedness in
my data, I’m including a log-transformation of my cash-out variable,
labelled *TipSumLog*, where TipSumLog = log(TipSum).[^2]

[^2]: Observation 37 had a TipSum value of 0, which means I could not
    take the log of the variable without dealing with the zero. I
    decided to drop the observation because a \$0 cash-out is very
    unlucky, and is almost certainly an outlier in our data set.

Finally, I gathered some historical precipitation data from an online
resource
(<https://pittmeadows.weatherstats.ca/charts/precipitation-daily.html>),
and added *precipitation* values in millimeters for each date in my data
set. I decided to categorize the numeric precipitation values into 4
different categories: No Rain, Light Rain, Moderate Rain and Heavy Rain.

To summarize, my main outcome variable is cash-out amount (Numeric,
dollars), my independent variables include Day of the Week
(Categorical), Weekend/Weekday Status (Dummy variable), Order amount
delivered (Numeric, dollars) and Rain levels (Categorical), all sorted
by the Date (Timeseries). Due to the nature of the data collection
process, there were one or two missing values caused by typos, which
were corrected in the data processing stage.

# Section III. Estimate Your OLS Models

Section III involves looking at the relationship between my main
independent variable and the outcome I am interested in. First, I will
look at the bivariate relationship. Then I will look at a more extensive
multivariate analysis and interpret the results for both hypotheses.

Regarding my first hypothesis, the bivariate regression between the
calendar day and cash-outs of all given dates does not produce any
significant results; we cannot say with certainty that any particular
day of the week is correlated with higher tip-outs. I could not even
begin to reject the main null hypothesis based on these results.

Turning to my second hypothesis, the bivariate regression between
weekday/weekend status and cash-outs does produce significant results.
We see that on average, weekends are correlated with a \$14.25 increase
in tips compared to weekdays: on average I make around \$27.48 in tips
on weekdays and \$41.73 on weekends.

Though accounting for our control variables for our first hypothesis
would theoretically produce a more accurate model, given the sheer
insignificance of these results a more precise model in the form of a
multiple regression analysis isn’t likely to produce results sufficient
to reject the null. Unlike the bivariate regression of our first model,
the model for our second hypothesis could very well benefit from the
addition of precipitation and order amount as control variables. It’s
completely possible that accounting for these two un-modeled variables
could rob significance from our results above.

When controlling for the order amount and the rain level we can see that
the order amount is significantly correlated with higher tips for both
hypotheses. In both cases, we see that a one dollar increase in the
order amount is correlated with a roughly \$0.14 increase in tips. This
makes a lot of sense, because tipping 15% of the order amount is
considered the norm, and a \$0.14 increase in tips for every dollar
increase in amount is roughly a 15% increase. Furthermore, we saw that
precipitation was not significantly correlated with cash-outs.

Regarding our first hypothesis, we now see that Sundays are
significantly correlated with a \$5.83 increase in tips compared to
Friday. Though this result is significant, it is not enough information
to confirm our hypothesis, because we don’t have significant values for
Saturday or Friday to compare Sunday to. This confirms my suspicion that
multiple regression does not make any progress in confirming my main
hypothesis.

Regarding our second hypothesis, weekends are no longer significantly
correlated with tips. This undermines our capacity to confirm our second
hypothesis, and reject our second null.

# Section IV Regression Diagnostics

In Section IV I confirm my analysis satisfies regression assumptions:
linearity, additivity, assumptions about the error terms (specifically,
usual cases and homoskedasticity), and multicollinearity. Each
assumption requires both an analysis and written explanation.

## Section IV, Part 1. Linearity

``` r
library(car)
crPlot(tpdlmm, "AmountSum")
```

![](Pizza-Delivery-Tip-Maxxing-Part-1_files/figure-gfm/sec4-lin-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
crPlot(tpwlmm, "AmountSum")
```

![](Pizza-Delivery-Tip-Maxxing-Part-1_files/figure-gfm/sec4-lin-2.png)<!-- -->

Non-linearity is when the relationship between an independent variable
and a dependent variable is not linear, i.e. not a straight line; a
curved line. Un-modelled non-linearity is a problem because it means a
linear model does not accurately represent the correlation between the
outcome and research variable. To test our assumption of linearity,
we’ll plot the residuals (the difference between the predicted value of
tips and the actual values) of our Tip variable against the order
amount. We’re looking for large deviations of residual (traced by a
smooth pink line) from the expected values (the dashed blue line), which
we don’t see for either hypothesis. This suggests that it’s safe to
assume our model is linear.

## Section IV, Part 2. Additivity

Non-additivity, also known as an interaction is when the relationship
between an independent variable and the outcome variable depends on the
values of another variable. Failure to account for interactions makes
less accurate linear models. To test additivity, we’ll model an
interaction between the day of the week/weekend status and the order
amount variable. The reason we’re testing an interaction between these
two independent variables, and not precipitation, is because I know from
experience that weekends are busier than week days, and therefore have
higher values of total order amount. It’s not necessarily that people
are ordering more food on weekends, rather there are just more people
ordering on weekends. However, even though order amounts are higher on
weekends, I believe that people will not be tipping more than their
order amount would predict on weekends than weekdays. I hypothesize that
the interaction between the day of the week/weekend status will have a
negligible correlation with tips, let’s say a positive coefficient
that’s less than 1, given that the interaction is in fact significant.
To be clear, my additivity hypothesis is a conditional proposition: IF
the interaction is significant, THEN the coefficient is positive but
less than one.

Since I already have two working hypotheses, I’ll have to test my
additivty hypothesis for both models. Interpreting the multiple
regression models including the interaction variable, we see that the
relationship between total order amount and cash-out amount is not
conditional on which day of the week it happens to be, or if it happens
to be a weekend. My conditional hypothesis was vacuously true for both
models because the interaction was not significant. (A conditional
proposition is true when it’s antecedent clause is false.) I could find
no significant interactions in my models, so it’s safe to assume our
data is additive.

A big problem I should’ve addressed first is outliers and skewness, AKA
non-normality. Normality is the assumption that the error terms of a
linear model are random, and do not follow any predictable pattern.
Failing to account for predictable patterns in the distribution of error
terms suggests that our regression model is missing some information
about the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the
outcome variable. This can happen when a few large outliers skew the
distribution of observations. Just looking at the distribution of
cash-outs, we can visually determine that our data is right skewed. To
determine if there are any outliers, I used the Bonferroni Outlier Test,
which uses a t-distribution to test whether the model’s largest
studentized error terms outlier status are significantly different from
other observations in the model. But before searching for any outliers,
let’s look at our model after a log transformation. The log
transformation will standardize the outcome variable, removing the
natural skewness of our data set. Applying Bonferroni outlier test after
the log transformation shows that observation 27 and 53 are outliers.
This suggests our model violates the assumption of normality.

Moving on, let’s test for heteroskedasticity. Heteroskedastcity is the
violation of the homoscedasticity assumption, which is the assumption
that the error terms is the same across observation, and does not
dependent on the values of the independent variables. Heteroskedasticity
refers to a systematic change in the variance of the residuals of the
range of observations, i.e. non-constant variance. To diagnose
non-constant variance in our observations, I used the non-constant
variance score test on our log-transformed regression model, which
determines if there is non-constant variance in our model. Any
significant p-values would mean our data suffers from
heteroskedasticity, but fortunately we do not see that issue. It’s safe
to assume our model is homoscedastic.

```

The fifth assumption of regression is that there is no perfect
(multi)collinearity in our model. Multicolinearity is when two or more
variables are highly linearly related. Even if our model is not
perfectly multicollinearly related, imperfect or near multiconllinearity
is still an issue because it can erroneously inflate variance. Although
I have no theoretical reason to believe that any of our independent
variables are perfect collinearities, or anywhere near perfect, to be
safe I ran a Variance Inflation Factor test, which measures how much
collinearity has increased the variance of our coefficients. As a rule
of thumb, any VIF score above 5 is considered problematic for the
regression model. Fortunately, I saw no evidence of multicollinearity in
either of my regression models. It’s safe to assume our model has no
perfect (or near perfect) multicollinearity.

The biggest issue in my model was non-normality. I fixed this by
logarithmic transformation of my outcome variable to standardize the
distribution of cash-outs, and then taking out the outliers. After
removing those outliers, we see a much more normal distribution in our
cash-outs. The last steps are to re-estimate our linear model including
our interaction variable. We finally have 2 final linear models for both
our hypotheses that do not violate the assumptions of linear regression.

The model for our first hypothesis didn’t see enough significant
results.

The model for our second hypothesis did create significant results.
Since we took the log transformation of our outcome variable, to
interpret the result we must work backwards to interpret the log value
of cash-outs on weekends, like so
![(exp(coef(logwlmP)\$\$"WeekendWeekend"\$\$) - 1) \*
100](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%28exp%28coef%28logwlmP%29%5B%22WeekendWeekend%22%5D%29%20-%201%29%20%2A%20100 "(exp(coef(logwlmP)["WeekendWeekend"]) - 1) * 100"),
which is equal to %106.16. Our linear model predicts that on weekends
(Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays), we make %106.16 more tips than on
weekdays.

# Section V. Conclusion

After some processing, we finally have enough information to assess our
hypotheses. Our first hypothesis, that on average the best three days
for cash-outs were Saturdays, Fridays and Sundays in that order was
assessed with a linear model accounting for non-normality and
non-additivity, and did not find sufficient evidence to reject the null
hypothesis that Saturdays, Fridays and Sundays are not the best three
days for cash-outs. However, our secondary hypothesis, that Weekends
(Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays) have on average higher cash-outs than
Weekdays (Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday), which was
assessed via a linear regression model accounting for non-normality and
non-additivity did see sufficient evidence to reject the null
hypothesis. I can say with confidence that working weekends is more
lucrative than working weekdays, and I will schedule my shifts
accordingly to maximize my income.Furthermore, I didn’t see any
significant results which indicated that higher levels of precipitation
are correlated at all with tips.

There’s another interesting outcome of this research that surprised me.
When looking at the frequency distribution of tips represented as a
percentage of the sale amount (see figure below), we see tips generally
gravitate towards 5 buckets: 12%, 15%, 16%, 18% and 20%. My initial
explanation for this distribution was that when paying for their orders
customers tend to defer to the preset tip-percentage amounts, with 15%
being the cultural norm. But this explanation fails because each credit
machine only has 3 preset tip percentage options to choose from, which
would predict 3 spikes in frequency at those percentages, not 5 spikes.
However, after some detective work I learned that some of the
credit-machines were programmed with different preset tip percentage
options than others. Some were programmed with the presets 12%, 16%,
18%, some with 15%, 18%, 20%, for a total of 5 possible outcomes. Not
only does this realization solve this mystery, it offers me a new means
of maximizing my tip money: when going on a delivery choose a
credit-machine with the higher tip preset options.

At the end of the day, although I’m confident in my regression model
prediction, I recognize the limitations of my data. Above all, my data
collection process leaves room for improvement. There needs to be a more
systematic way of recording sales data and driver activity to make a
more comprehensive and larger scale statistical analysis. Furthermore,
although I refer to this data as my own, in reality this data was
collected via a handful of different delivery drivers. I could not
differentiate between an order I took and an order another driver took
by looking at the receipt, which leaves me wondering if some drivers get
tipped more than others. If so, what properties do those drivers
possess? I suspect the correlation between looks and tips is a well
studied phenomenon in waitresses, but I wonder what such a study could
look like for male delivery drivers like myself.
