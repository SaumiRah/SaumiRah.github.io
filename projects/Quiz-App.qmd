### Interpretation
Goal: develop a GUI program that allows the user to create quizzes, add questions to those quizzes, take the quizzes after adding questions and receive a final score at the end of quiz. The Quiz program should also be able to preview the quizzes after creating questions.

### Analysis of tasks - required techniques and algorithms to accomplish the goal.

Quiz and multiple choice question design: 

1. `Quiz_item` class models multiple choice questions, with a question, set of choices and correct answer.
   - Besides a constructor, including methods to set the question, choices and answer after they're created.

2. `Quiz` class models a quiz. Uses Quiz_item objects as quiz questions. 
   - A method allows user to take the quiz, iterating through each quiz_item object in the quiz, displaying the question and the corresponding possible choices one by one. Allows the user to return the answer they believe to be correct. 
   - Once the quiz is complete, the user's total score as a percentage and any corrections are displayed.
   - Besides a constructor and the quiz taking method, other methods include: add a quiz_item objects to the quiz and preview all quiz item questions, choices and answers in a quiz.

GUI design and program logic:

1. `QuizApp` class provides the GUI and methods for the program. Uses `Tkinter` module.
   1. Main Menu: 
      1. Create a new Quiz object, and add it to a dict of `quiz name:quiz object` pairs.
      - Use a simple dialogue box to get user to input a name for the new quiz.
      2. Select a quiz from the quizzes dictionary.
      - Dynamically create new buttons for each quiz in the quizzes dict. Buttons allow you to select a quiz to manage/execute.
   2. Quiz menu (upon selecting quiz)
      1. Add quiz_item objects to selected quiz
         - Use entry boxes to collect the quiz_item question and choices attributes
         - Use Radiobuttons to select the correct choice as the answer attribute.
         - Validate the proposed Quiz_item object, create it if valid, and add it to the selected Quiz object.
      2. Preview the question, choices and correct answer for each quiz_item object for the select quiz.
         - Iterate through the Quiz_items in the selected quiz, and return a formated string containing the question, choices and correct answer in a simple message box for each Quiz_item object.
         - Return a warning message box if the quiz has no quiz_items in it
      3. Execute the selected quiz after adding quiz_item objects to it.
            - First checks if selected quiz object has any quiz items. 
            - Presents questions for user to select the correct answer to one question at a time.
            - Increment score variable for each correct answer
            - Store quiz items answered correctly to find any corrections (if any) upon exiting the quiz.
              - Dynamically update a label for each question in the quiz, to show the quiz question.
              - Dynamically create buttons for each quiz question to allow user to pick an answer to the question.
            - When taking the quiz, a countdown timer and a "Question ['question number'] out of ['total number of questions']" label is visible to the user. If the countdown timer reaches zero, the user gets those questions wrong in the final score.
              - Updated every second
            - Quiz exit conditions:
              - The number of questions answered by the user = the number of quiz_item objets in the quiz object; or,
              - The timer reaches 0. 
   3. Upon exiting the quiz, display the final score as a percentage after the quiz is over, and all corrections if any.
   - A method for clearing widgets from the parent window. Need to run this every time the user switches menus. Ran every time user changes menus, begins or finishes a quiz. 
   - "Return to previous menu" buttons should be available everywhere except for during the quiz.

### Explanation of modules, classes, and functions

#### Modules:

- `tkinter` package used to create the GUI components of the program.
  - `ttk` module for aesthetically pleasing GUI components
  - `simpledialog` and `messagebox` modules to open asktring and messagebox boxes for the user interface.

#### Classes:
#### `Quiz_item` - Models individual quiz items that can be added to quizzes.

Attributes:

- `question` - The string containing the question.
- `choices` - A variable length argument containing the possible answers to the question.
- `answer` - The correct answer, validated to be one of the provided possible answers.


Methods:

- `set_question(new_question)` - Updates the question description.
- `set_choices(choice_number, new_choice)` - Updates the specified possible choice.
- `set_answer(new_answer)` - Sets the correct answer, ensuring validity.
- `preview()` - Returns a string containing the question and choices of the `Quiz_item` objects.

#### `Quiz` - Models Quizzes, acting like collections of Quiz_item objects with additional methods and functionality.

Attributes: 

- `quizItemList` - A list of `Quiz_item` objects.
- `title` - The title of the quiz.

Methods:

- `add_question(quizItem)` - Add `Quiz_item` object to the `quizItemList`.
- `display_questions()` - Returns string of questions, choices and answers for GUI display.
- `take_quiz` - Executes quiz on user, returns final score calculation and all corrections if any.

#### `QuizApp` - Provides the GUI and methods for the program.

Attributes:

- `root` - the parent window for the GUI application (which is initialized in the main execution)
- `quizzes` - a dictionary containing quizzes.
- `main_menu_quizzes_frame` - Frame widget containing main menu buttons to select quiz
- `current_quiz` and `current_quiz_name` - The selected quiz object and its name
- `answer_var` - Variable holding the user's selected answer as an integer
- `question_entry` - the question of a new quiz item 
- `choices_entries` - list containing choices of a new quiz item
- `score` - holds the score of as the user proceeds through a quiz
- `current_question_index` - holds the index of the current Quiz_item objects in `quizItemList` as the user proceeds through the quiz
- `time_total` - the total time the user has to take the quiz, in seconds
- `time_remaining` - the time remaining the user has to complete the quiz, max = `time_total` and min = 0.
- `timer_running_flag` - flag set to False by default, set to True when Timer widget is activated
